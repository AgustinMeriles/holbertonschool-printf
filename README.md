### Usage
````_printf```` function may be used in any C language program. This is the prototype: 

````_printf(const char *[FORMAT], ...)````

FORMAT refers to a string with any number of specifiers followed by a ‘%’ symbol. i.e. "My name is %s and I am %d years old". … refers to a list of variadic (variable arguments in C Language), which can be any number of variables of any type. With the above example string, appropriate arguments could be "Edwin Abbott Abbott", 179. These examples together should be called like so:

````_printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old", "Edwin Abbott Abbott", 179)````
